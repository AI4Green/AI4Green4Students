## Green versus Sustainable Chemistry

Green chemistry focuses on the design, manufacture and use of chemicals to decrease pollution potential. It is an approach that provides a fundamental methodology for changing the intrinsic nature of a chemical product or process so that it is inherently of less risk to human and the environment, to prevent pollution and thereby solve environmental problems, promoting pollution prevention and industrial ecology.

Sustainable chemistry is a scientific concept that seeks to improve the efficiency with which natural resources are used to meet human needs for chemical products and services. It encompasses the design, manufacture and use of efficient, effective, safe and more environmentally benign chemical products and processes. Sustainable chemistry comprises both the impressions of green chemistry and the effects of processing, materials, energy and economics.

To successfully measure the sustainability of a chemical reaction, mass-based metrics, which measure the environmental impact of waste, such as as life cycle assessment (LCA) and metrics for assessing the economic viability of products and processes must be considered. Sustainable design is guided by principles such as 12 Principles of Green Engineering and Life Cycle Assessment and 12 Principles of Green Chemistry.
