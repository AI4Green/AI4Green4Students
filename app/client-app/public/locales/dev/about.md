## About AI4Green4Students

AI4Green4students is a pedagogical version of AI4Green, open-source software developed in the group of Jonathan Hirst at the University of Nottingham, UK.

Our goal is simple- to develop a high-quality AI-powered electronic laboratory notebook for undergraduate chemists. This platform will train students to be more aware of sustainability, and competent in research data management and data analytics.

This work is supported by a grant from the Royal Academy of Engineering.
